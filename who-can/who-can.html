<h1>Who Can...?</h1>
<p>Managing a Kubernetes cluster with one user is easy. Once you go beyond one user, you need to start using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). I've delved into this topic several times in the past with posts on how to <a href="https://capstonec.com/create-a-user-k8s-sandbox-in-docker-ee/">Create a Kubernetes User Sandbox in Docker Enterprise</a> and <a href="https://capstonec.com/dev-test-and-prod-k8s-namespaces-in-docker-ee/">Functional Kubernetes Namespaces in Docker Enterprise</a>. But, once you get beyond a couple of users and/or teams and a few namespaces for them, it quickly becomes difficult to keep track of who can do what and where. And, as time goes on and more and more people have a hand in setting up your RBAC, it can get even more confusing. You can and should have your RBAC resource definitions in source control but it's not easy to read and is hard to visualize. Enter the open source <a href="https://github.com/aquasecurity/kubectl-who-can">who-can</a> kubectl plugin from the folks at <a href="https://www.aquasec.com/">Aqua Security</a>. It gives you the ability to show who (subjects) can do what (verbs) to what (resources) and where (namespaces).</p>
<h2>Install the Krew Plugin Manager</h2>
<p>The who-can plugin for kubectl requires the krew plugin manager. If you don't already have krew installed, the instructions for installing it can be found on its GitHub repository, https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/krew/. To verify it's installed correctly, you can get a list of available plugins from kubectl.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ kubectl plugin list
The following kubectl-compatible plugins are available:

/home/ken.rider/.krew/bin/kubectl-krew
</code></pre>
<h2>Install the Who-Can Plugin</h2>
<p>Once you have the krew plugin manager for kubectl, installing the who-can plugin is easy.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ kubectl krew install who-can
</code></pre>
<h2>Setting up RBAC for our Cluster</h2>
<p>Now that we have who-can installed, let's try it out. I have a Kubernetes cluster I built in Azure using <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-enterprise">Docker Enterprise</a>. I have 3 (non-default) namespaces for development, test, and production. I also have teams for development, test, operations, and security which I've created as a cluster admin user. I've defined a set of RoleBindings for each along the lines of those I used in my blog post on functional namespaces but taking advantage of the default ClusterRoles created with the Docker Enterprise installation. (See https://github.com/CapKenR/blog/tree/master/who-can for details on the RBAC definition I'm using here.)</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ kubectl apply -f development-namespace.yaml
namespace/development created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/dev-team:development-edit created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/test-team:development-view created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/ops-team:development-admin created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/sec-team:development-view created
$ kubectl apply -f test-namespace.yaml
namespace/test created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/dev-team:test-view created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/test-team:test-edit created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/ops-team:test-admin created

$ kubectl apply -f production-namespace.yaml
namespace/production created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/dev-team:production-view created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/test-team:production-view created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/ops-team:production-admin created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/sec-team:production-view created
</code></pre>
<h2>Take Who-Can for a Spin</h2>
<p>Once you have who-can installed, its usage is very straightforward.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ kubectl kubectl who-can VERB (TYPE | TYPE/NAME | NONRESOURCEURL) [flags]
</code></pre>
<p>The typical set of verbs you may be interested in is <code>get</code>, <code>list</code>, <code>watch</code>, <code>create</code>, <code>update</code>, <code>patch</code>, and <code>delete</code>. There are a few others for specific resource types but, in general, you will be most interested in <code>get</code>, <code>create</code>, and <code>delete</code>.</p>
<p>The typical set of resource types you may be interested in includes <code>pods</code>, <code>deployments</code>, <code>services</code>, <code>persistentvolumeclaims</code>, <code>configmaps</code>, <code>secrets</code>, and more. Also, with the ever-expanding use of <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/"><code>CustomResourceDefinitions</code></a>, the list of resource types is never-ending.</p>
<h2>Who-Can Examples</h2>
<p>Let's first ask &quot;who can get pods in the development namespace?&quot; Notice that all of the teams I created can get (see) pods. There are also quite a few others but most are system service accounts created during the cluster installation. One, tiller, isn't and we'll talk about it later.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ kubectl who-can get pods -n development

<p>Now let's ask &quot;who can create pods in the development namespace?&quot; Here we see that only our development and operations teams can create pods there. And the list of system service accounts is shorter but tiller is still there.</p>

<p>Next, we'll ask &quot;who can update anything in the development namespace?&quot; Notice that our development can't just update anything they want in the development namespace with the edit role. For example, they can't update a <code>RoleBinding</code>. We don't want them to be able to change their own permissions. Yet, tiller is there again.</p>

<p>Let's talk about that tiller service account. The tiller service account is used by Helm to manage resources in a Kubernetes cluster. However, unless you explicitly limit its capabilities, by default the tiller account can do anything with any resource in any namespace. If you need to use helm, you need to implement RBAC for tiller to limit your security exposure. (Or, you could just wait for Helm 3 which doesn't require tiller.)</p>
<p>Next, let's look at the other namespaces. &quot;Who can create services in the test namespace?&quot; As you'd expect, only the test and operations teams can.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ kubectl who-can create services -n test
